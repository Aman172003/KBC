The project "Koun Banega Crorepati(KBC)" is a console-based quiz game implemented in Python. Inspired by the popular TV show, the game challenges players with a series of multiple-choice questions. By answering these questions correctly, players can accumulate virtual winnings and progress towards becoming a virtual crorepati (millionaire).
The core component of this project is a set of lists that store the questions and their corresponding answers. Each question is represented as a string, and the answers are matched to their respective questions at the same index in another list. This data structure allows for easy retrieval and validation of answers.
When the game starts, players are presented with a question from the list. The question is displayed on the console, and players are prompted to enter their answer. The input function is used to gather the user's response.
The program compares the user's answer with the correct answer stored in the list. If the answer matches, the player's score is updated, and a success message is displayed. In case of an incorrect answer, an appropriate message is shown, and the game ends.
